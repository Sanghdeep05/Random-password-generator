# Random-password-generator
Project 2 I've developed a Python script that generates secure random passwords based on user-defined preferences. It's all about empowering users to create strong, customized passwords tailored to their needs.
Users can specify the length of the password and select character types—letters, numbers, symbols—to include. The script then generates a unique password meeting their criteria using Python's secrets module.
